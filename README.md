Serenity, a Mental Health app to combat rising mental health problems developed for a Hacakthon held at Northern Illinois University between Feb 23-24,2019

It should be noted this was uploaded after much of the work was completed on Floobits, thus the commits do not necessarily reflect who did which parts.
